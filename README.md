# Task Master

## Description 
- Task Master is a task-tracking application with the same basic goal as Trello: allow users to keep 
track of tasks to be done and their status. While weâ€™ll start today with a basic feature set,
 we will continue building out the capabilities of this application over time.
 
## API
- ```@GetMapping("/tasks")```
  - returns json data from the dynamodb
- ```@PostMapping("/tasks)```
  - should post tasks to the dynamodb
- ```@PutMapping("/tasks/{id}/state")```
  - should update task status
- ```@GetMapping("/users/{assignee}/tasks) ```
  - should show the tasks that are assigned to that assignee
- ```@PutMapping("/tasks/{id}/assign/{assignee}) ```
  - can assign tasks to an assignee
- ```@DeleteMapping("/tasks/{id}")```
  - can delete a task
-  ```PostMapping("/tasks/{id}/images")
  - can update a task with an image
